#Backbone Components#
A Component System for use with backbone.

#Requirements#
The components themselves rely on Backbone (and Underscore), JQuery, Require, and Mustache

#To Use#
For use, copy the "js/Components" directory to your project and use as needed.

Below is the standard way to use the button:

```JavaScript
var model = new Backbone.Model({
    prop: "name"
});

var buttonComponent = new ButtonComponent({
    model: model,
    property: "prop",
    onClick: function () {
        done();
    }
});

buttonComponent.render();
```

The following is also an aceptable use case, however you lose the data-binding of the Backbone Model

```JavaScript
var buttonComponent = new ButtonComponent({
    model: "name",
    onClick: function () {
        done();
    }
});

buttonComponent.render();
```

Use a Component View (a component that has the ability to have sub-components) as follows:

```JavaScript
this.mainView = new ComponentView({
  template: '<div class="socket-one"></div><div class="socket-two"></div>',
  model: ""
});

this.mainView.components[".socket-one"] = [buttonComponent, textComponent];
this.mainView.components[".socket-two"] = toggleComponent;
```

#Example App#

A live preview is available at http://awoitte.github.io/backbone-components/ 

To run the example app locally:

Due to the way requirejs pulls in files from other directories you'll need to host the files on a server before you can see the example running (running directly from the files makes the browser think it's an XSS attack). If you want to do this with node follow the steps below:

Make sure node is installed and then run the command:

```JavaScript
npm install connect serve-static
```

you can then start the server with:

```JavaScript
node server
```

The page is now accesible at http://localhost:8080

#Custom Components#

When creating a custom component be sure to call the super of any function you extend.

A good example of this is the hidable component:

```JavaScript
! function() {
  'use strict';

  define([
    'Components/Base/ComponentView'
  ], function(ComponentView) {

    var HidableComponent = ComponentView.extend({

      render: function() {
        HidableComponent.__super__.render.apply(this, arguments);
        var visibility = this.options.isHidden ? this.options.isHidden(this.model) : this.model.get(this.options.property);
        this.$el.toggle(!!visibility);
      },

    });

    return HidableComponent;
  });
}();
```

The Components in the "Base" folder were designed to be extended from to make Custom components.
